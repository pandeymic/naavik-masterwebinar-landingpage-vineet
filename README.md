## Proof of Testing
Form Tested with Sample Entries
The registration form was tested by submitting sample entries for each required field (Name, Email, Phone, Organization, City). Upon successful submission, a confirmation alert appears on the screen, indicating that the form data was sent to the Formspree endpoint. The form is configured to prevent submission with empty fields due to the required attribute.
